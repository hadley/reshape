Version 1.2.1
-------------

* Fix bug in multiple margins revealed by plyr 1.7, but caused by mis-use of
  data frame subsetting.

* Fixed a bug in `melt` where it didn't automatically get variable names
  when used with tables. (Thanks to Winston Chang)

Version 1.2 
-----------

* Fixed bug in melt where factors were converted to integers, instead of to
  characters

* When the measured variable is a factor, `dcast` now converts it to a
  character rather than throwing an error. `acast` still returns a factor
  matrix. (Thanks to Brian Diggs.)

* `acast` is now much faster, due to fixing a very slow way of naming the 
   output. (Thanks to José Bartolomei Díaz for the bug report)

* `value_var` argument to `acast` and `dcast` renamed to `value.var` to be
  consistent with other argument names

* Order `NA` factor levels before `(all)` when creating margins

* Corrected reshape citation.

Version 1.1
-----------

* `melt.data.frame` no longer turns characters into factors

* All melt methods gain a `na.rm` and `value.name` arguments - these
  previously were only possessed by `melt.data.frame` (Fixes #5)
